This program is use to find if a given number from a user is a prime number or not. If it's a prime number it will be shown as so.
But if it isn't a prime number then the program will check the preivous numbers and tell the primes before the user given number

for an example:
  if the user inputs 100 as a number it will say 100 is not a prime number and will give the following as prime numbers 
  100 is not a prime number
  
99
97 is a prime number
95
93
91
89 is a prime number
87
85
83 is a prime number
81
79 is a prime number
77
75
73 is a prime number
71 is a prime number
69
67 is a prime number
65
63
61 is a prime number
59 is a prime number
57
55
53 is a prime number
51
49
47 is a prime number
45
43 is a prime number
41 is a prime number
39
37 is a prime number
35
33
31 is a prime number
29 is a prime number
27
25

This program will work only if the input number is higher than 25, also this is not a perfect program. The reason is that it uses a mod function to determine if it's a prime 
or not. I only added mod until 23.
